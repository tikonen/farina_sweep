# Distortion analysis using "Farina Sweep" method.

"Farina Sweep" is a method for measuring impulse response and distortion with a single logarithmic sine sweep.  [[1]](#1).

This implementation is for Octave 8.3.0 and attempts to be a demonstration of the analysis method that can be further improved and adapted.
